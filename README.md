RaceDay is a mobile app that helps you track all of your racing data in one place! This app was something I designed to align with my passion for cars and racing. Having to go through my pictures and find pictures of timeslips and dates was just a bit too time consuming, so that's why I wanted to create this app. It provides a place to store all of your racing data in one spot so the next time you want to share this information with others or even check on previous stats you don't have to spend too long searching for that information.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React-Native-Expo

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was to help me understand the backend better. Being able to store data was a crucial aspect to this app. Being able to also work on something that I share a passion about was also awesome. I can't wait to implement what I've learned building this project to future aspects of my life. Hopefully this app will mean something to someone other than myself in the future.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
